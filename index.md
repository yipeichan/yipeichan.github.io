# [_Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)_](./mlp_numpy.html)   
<div class="d"></div>
In this article, I wrote a two-layer neural network from scratch and applied it to the CIFAR-10 dataset. The notebook is one of the assignments of the Deep Learning Course at Columbia University.  <br>

# [_Logistic Regression & Softmax Classifier with SGD_](./basic_classifiers.html)   
<div class="d"></div>
In this article, I wrote two classifiers-- Logistic regression classifier and Softmax classifier with stochastic gradient descent, and applied them to the CIFAR-10 dataset. The notebook is one of the assignments of the Deep Learning Course at Columbia University.  <br>

# [_Classify Images With Deep Learning_](./mnist.html)   
<div class="d"></div>
This article uses deep learning to predict the numbers in the images from the MNIST Dataset. I used Tensorflow Keras, setting the activation function as sigmoid function, and output function as softmax function. <br>

# [_Titanic Survival Prediction_](./Titanic.html)   
<div class="d"></div>
This is the legendary Titanic ML competition on Kaggle. I use ridge regression, lasso regression, random forest and gradient boosted models to make the survival prediction and compare the error rates among different models. <br>

# [_Credit Card Default Prediction_](./default.html)   
<div class="d"></div>
This article uses logistic regression and the ROC curve to predict the credit card default rate of clients. I wrote the ROC curve function and compared the error rate in using different thresholds to classify default status. <br>
