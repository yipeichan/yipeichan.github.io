# [_Bayesian Convolutional Neural Networks with Variational Inference_](./BayesianCNN_Yi_Pei_Chan.pdf)   
<div class="d"></div>
In this report, we investigated recent works in using Bayesian Convolutional Neural Networks with variational inference to perform image classification tasks. Based on ideas introduced by Shridhar et al. in 2019, we reproduced the Bayesian LeNet model and tested the performance of our network on image classification tasks with MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets. We as well compared the validation accuracies generated with Bayesian approach to those generated with frequentist inference under the LeNet architecture. At the end of the paper, we discussed possible reasons for the discrepancies and provided promising future works that can potentially improve the model performance in the original paper.

# [_Deep Reinforcement Learning for MiniGrid_](./AdvML_deepRL.pdf)   
<div class="d"></div>
In this project I studied the application of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in solving problems in the MiniGrid gym environment and a classic control problem CartPole. Specifically, I employed the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm which is a modified version of actor-critic policy gradient method. I choose two testing environments from the MiniGrid environment and the CartPole environment from OpenAI Gym to verify my implementations.

# [_Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)_](./task3_cnn.html)   
<div class="d"></div>
In contrast to the Multi-Layer Perceptron (ML) or fully-connected (FC) nets, Convolutional Neural Networks are a more powerful tool often used in the field of computer vision. In this article, I created a CNN using Tensorflow. The notebook is one of the assignments of the Deep Learning Course at Columbia University.

# [_DBScan v.s. MeanShift & Adam v.s. Adagrad_](./advancedML.html)   
<div class="d"></div>
In this article, I compared the performance of DBScan and MeanShift algorithms on specially generated datasets. In addition, I examine the performance of two popular gradient-based optimization algorithms Adam & Adagrad by writing them from scratch. The notebook is based on one of the assignments of the Advanced Machine Learning Course at Columbia University.  <br>

# [_MLP Tensforflow & t-SNE_](./mlp_tensorflow.html)   
<div class="d"></div>
In this task, I created the same MLP network that I created in the previous article, but with Tensforflow library this time. Also, I experimented with t-SNE in visualizing high-dimensional data in 2D for CIFAR10. The notebook is one of the assignments of the Deep Learning Course at Columbia University.  <br>
