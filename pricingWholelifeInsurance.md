### A Life Insurance Policy Catered to Human Life Cycle

This program was modified from one of the insurance products that I devised. It launched market on November 30th, and had pretty good sales record. The insurance contract provides annuity and death coverage. 

The main target client group of this contract are people age between 20 to 55.
