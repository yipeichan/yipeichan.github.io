### A Life Insurance Policy Catered to Human Life Cycle 
This program was modified from one of the insurance products that I devised. It launched market on November 30th, and had pretty good sales record. The insurance contract provides both annuity and death coverage. 

The main target client group of this contract are people age between 20 to 55. For people in such range are often those who bring home the backon, and thus they went out to work, on business trevels frequently, which exposed them to higher risks on streets or abroad. Once accidents strike, he/she may lose the ability to work, affecting the financial situation of the entire family.
