I came across the term "Statistical Learning" when watching a talk on Youtube delivered by Larry Wasserman in 2017. And I was soon intrigued by the new approaches in extracting information from data. In making predictions, before then, I was familiar with, mainly model slection techniques, AIC, BIC, and linear/ logisitc regressions, etc. as these were taught in the course  Econometrics and I had direct implement in my bechalor thesis.<br>
<br>
The greatest change that Statistical Learning had on me was the notion: Predictive accuracy on test sets is the criteion for how good the model is.
