I came across the term "Statistical Learning" when watching a talk on Youtube delivered by Larry Wasserman in 2017. And I was soon intrigued by the new approaches in extracting information from data. In making predictions, before then, I was familiar with modeling techniques, like selecting with AIC, BIC, and linear/ logisitc regressions, dummy variables, etc. as these were taught in the course Econometrics and I had direct implement in my bechalor thesis.<br>
<br>
The greatest change that Statistical Learning had on me was the notion: <br>
<b>Predictive accuracy on test sets is the criteion for how good the model is.</b><br>
